# Take A Look At

- Wish problems had more context/applicability
- Down the rabbit hole .... what?!
- Git/GitHub struggles
- Need do and don't list
- Grading needs to be more prompt
- More pre-made examples
- More clear definition of where abilities are expected to be
- Handling differences in abilities through start of class (already knew JS, etc)
- Be more specific about what should and should not be used yet
- Sharing others' projects
- Watching others' repositories to track their progress
- Encouraging pairing/collaboration when not explicitly directed to
- Large readings could use some focus points
- When functions are covered
